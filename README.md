## Requirements & Tips for better performance
1. Android version 6.0 or greater.
2. App update itself using internet, you can see new content coming.
3. BTW if once you have a set of data stored then it will be saved for offline.
4. In order to see new content you must have a internet connection.
5. Make sure bandwidth of your connection is atleast 50kbps, otherwise the app may crash, Im trying to fix it asap.
6. If the app hangs at some point, then try restarting the app.
7. If the app crashes and it dosen't stops after few restarts then, try reinstalling it.
8. The app uses AsyncTask to make http requests in the background, sometimes when the server fails to respond before the timeout (or your internet is slow) it crashes the app. You can stop this by turning off the internet. I am thinking of using some downloading services.
9. Dont be rude with the app, in other words use the app smoothly, fastly switching between activities may crash it, again Im trying to fix it :(
